# High-Performance Gluon Kernels on AMD GFX9

A hands-on tutorial for writing **high-performance Gluon kernels** on AMD **MI350 / MI355** GPUs (gfx950).

**Why Gluon, not Triton?** Triton's strength is hardware-portable productivity: kernel authors describe what to compute and the compiler decides scheduling, register allocation, and layout. That abstraction is the right call for most kernels. For peak-performance kernels on a specific architecture, the compiler has to rediscover pipeline structure from generic IR, and the last 10–20% of performance is hard to reach. Gluon is a Triton dialect that closes that gap: a **block-level programming model** where you engineer pipelines, budget registers, and design layouts explicitly. The compiler's job narrows to faithful lowering and throughput-aware interleaving; the hard parts of traditional GPU compilation (NP-hard scheduling, graph-coloring register allocation) become design problems the kernel author owns. Triton remains the right tool for portable code; Gluon is the tool when you need to extract every last percent on a target GPU. See [`docs/performance_philosophy.md`](docs/performance_philosophy.md) for the full argument.

The headline result: on `a16w16` (FP16, 4096×4096×8192), the naive Gluon baseline runs at **543 TFLOPS**. Nine versions later, it reaches **1608 TFLOPS** — a **~3.0× speedup**, every step motivated by a thread trace or a hardware counter. This repo is not a collection of finished kernels; it is the record of that journey, kept so readers can see *how* near-peak performance is built, not just what the final kernel looks like.

## Start Here

If this is your first time in the repo, open **[`kernels/gemm/intra_wave/a16w16/README.md`](kernels/gemm/intra_wave/a16w16/README.md)** and follow the Acts I–IV narrative from `v0_naive` to `v9_beyond_hotloop`. Each version isolates one concept — a layout, a pipeline stage, a scheduling decision. Read it alongside the code, then run the kernel:

```bash
cd kernels/gemm/intra_wave/a16w16
python bench.py --version 0 --K 8192 --dtype fp16
```

Once you're comfortable there, the BF8 and MXFP4 kernels (`a8w8`, `a4w4`) show how the same design transfers to 8-bit and 4-bit compute with microscaling. Then [`kernels/attention/`](kernels/attention/README.md) takes the same reasoning to Flash Attention, where a third kind of instruction — the softmax's vector math — has to share a SIMD with the matrix pipe.

> [!TIP]
> Every version README follows the same shape: **Motivation → Design → Performance Analysis → What Comes Next.** If you only want the fastest FP16 kernel, jump to `v9_beyond_hotloop`. If you want to understand *why* it's fast, start from `v0_naive`.

## The Tutorial Progression

| Kernel    | Data Type | Tile Size    | What's New                                                        |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `a16w16`  | FP16      | 256×256×64   | Foundation — all techniques introduced here across v0 → v9        |
| `a8w8`    | BF8       | 256×256×128  | Same design, larger `BLOCK_K`, 32-cycle scaled MFMA               |
| `a4w4`    | MXFP4     | 256×256×256  | Adds the scale pipeline (GR → LW → LR), 16-cycle MFMA, LDS port contention |
| `attention` | FP16 / BF16 | 256×64, D=128 | Flash Attention forward: MFMA ↔ VALU **co-execution**, lazy softmax rescale |

The a16w16 series is the tutorial; a8w8 and a4w4 are what the same design looks like once you change the data type. Each one assumes you've read the previous. `attention` comes after all of them: it reuses the 8-wave warp pipeline from `inter_wave/` and asks what changes when the work competing for the SIMD is arithmetic rather than memory.

## What's Next

Today the tutorial covers GEMM for **16-bit (FP16)**, **8-bit (BF8)** and **MXFP4** compute, plus **Flash Attention forward** (prefill) in `kernels/attention/`. Planned additions: **memory-bound GEMM**, **FA decode**, and an **MXFP4 MoE** kernel. See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for details.

Performance engineering is not magic. It's a process. This repo tries to make that process explicit — one measured bottleneck at a time.
